        <h2>The Boys in the Boat</h2>
        <p>Here are some quotes I liked from the book...</p>
        <p>"So is life: the very problems you must overcome also support you and make you stronger in overcoming them." - George Yeoman Pocock (53)</p>
        <p>"The only time you <i>don't</i> find a four-leaf clover," he liked to say, "is when you stop looking for one." - Joe Rantz (69)</p>
        <p>The word, Pocock murmured, taught us about survival, about overcoming difficulty, about prevailing over adversity, but it also taught us something about the underlying reason for surviving in the first place. Something about infinite beauty, about undying grace, about things larger and greater than ourselves. About the reasons we were all here. "Sure, I can make a boat," he said, and then added, quoting the Poet Joyce Kilmer, "But only God can make a tree." - George Pocock (214)</p>
        <p>The ability to yield, to bend, to give way, to accommodate, he said, was sometimes a source of strength in men as well as in wood, so long as it was helmed by inner resolve and by principle. - George Pocock (215)</p>
        <p>He said for him the craft of building a boat was like religion. It wasn't enough to master the technical details of it. You had to give yourself up to it spiritually; you had to surrender yourself absolutely to it. When you were done and walked away from the boat, you had to feel that you had a left a piece of yourself behind in it forever, a bit of your heart. He turned to Joe. "Rowing," he said, "is like that. And a lot of life is like that too, the parts that really matter anyway. Do you know what I mean, Joe?" Joe, a bit nervous, not at all certain that he did, nodded tentatively, went back downstairs, and resumed his sit-ups, trying to work it out. (215)</p>
