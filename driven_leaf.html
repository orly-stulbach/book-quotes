        <h2><i>As A Driven Leaf</i></h2>
        <h4>Here are some quotes I liked from the book...</h4>
        <p>"Force yourself to believe and the problem is solved." - Nicholaus (201)</p>
        <p>“For decision lies not in my will, but in my conscience, and over that I have no control. But it is sweet to know that, come what may, there are those who love me beyond themselves.” - Elisha ben Abuyah (233)</p>
        <p>Then she recognized how estranged they were, how powerless she was to reach the core of his being. (234)</p>
        <p>“Do you imagine that any earthly power can crush a people that lives to communicate a God-given message of faith, justice and mercy to all men?” - Akiva (239)</p>
        <p>“Your suggestion is like the procedure of those Greek philosophers who say, 'I do not trust my reason, but I will use it to prove that I have no right to use it.' A man may insist that he lays a doctrine aside, but if it is integral to him, he will carry it with him wherever he goes and will inevitably find it again since it has never left him…You can only remove from yourself that which is not part of you.” - Akiva (241)</p>
        <p>“The purpose of life…is to live well. Whatever contributes toward that end is right and true.” - Akiva (241)</p>
        <p>“'All is foreseen by God, yet man possesses freedom of will.'…But there is a higher logic, a rationality that springs from the necessities of human nature. Does not man face life with greater assurance if he believes that a benevolent providence foresees the future? And yet he must at the same time be confident that his will is free, otherwise moral effort is meaningless altogether. Doctrines themselves are not important to me, but their consequences are…If any doctrine enlarges life, then it possesses truth in realms beyond Aristotle's logic.” - Akiva (242)</p>
        <p>“Belief need not be unseeing. Is it a darkening of counsel to admit that truth is not a matter of the mind alone, but of the heart and experience also? Since it cannot be obtained by reason unaided, faith is indispensable both as a base on which thought may stand, and as a check-rein when logic goes astray.” - Akiva (243)</p>
        <p>“'I am hidden among multitudes of men. What is my soul in their great numbers?’” - Ben Sira (261)</p> 
        <p>“For though character is constant, the circumstances surrounding it are not. And it is these ultimately which determine whether personality shall be large or stunted…"</p>
        <p>A pleasurable sense of unreality pervaded him. He sat, wallowing in a half-hypnosis, listening to words that made no sense, but which he was for the time convinced were infinitely meaningful. (317)</p>
        <p>“Otherwise, I might despise the good because of the evil intermingled with it.” - Elisha (341)</p>
        <p>Now, taciturn and withdrawn, he sat, his consciousness divided, each fragment pressing its own existence, each struggling for predominance over the others. (345)</p>
        <p>“I did not have the will to do what I knew to be wise.” - Lady Manto (349)</p>
        <p>They were rather companions, adventuring along the road he traveled. (359)</p>
        <p>“To you philosophy is a science. To me it is an art. To you it is a method of discovering the truth. To me it is a guide to noble living.” - Demonax (366)</p>
        <p>“The human scene is not some philosophers garden, but a confusing, dark style.” - Demonax (368)</p>
        <p>“Suppose people are lost in some dark and threatening forest without food or shelter. Ought not someone climb a tree to discern the forest as a whole and the paths by which he and his fellows can escape from it?” - Elisha ben Abuyah (368)</p>
        <p>“Only if there be first an indisputable interpretation of reality and a moral system drawn from it, will men be able to live, as engineers and architects work, with assurance.” - Elisha ben Abuyah (368-369)</p>
        <p>“Someone has to try. Why not I? Someone will succeed. Perhaps I.” - Elisha ben Abuyah (369)</p>
        <p>“It is a sublime creation, rich in the moral truths that mankind needs more than metaphysics.” - Demonax (370)</p>
