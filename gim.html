        <h2>A Gentleman in Moscow</h2>
        <h4>Here are some quotes I liked from the book...</h4>
        <p>"When you reach our age, Vasily, it all goes by so quickly. Whole seasons seem to pass without leaving the slightest mark on our memory...
            But surely, there is a comfort to be taken from that," continued the Count. "For even as weeks begin racing by in a blur for us, they are making the greatest of impressions upon our children. When one turns seventeen and begins to experience that first period of real independence, one's senses are so alert, one's sentiments so finely attuned that every conversation, every look, every laugh may be writ indelibly upon one's memory. And the friends that one happens to make in those impressionable years? One will meet them forever after with a welling of affection...

Perhaps the aggregate experience of Time is a constant and thus for our children to establish such a vivid impression of this particular June, we must relinquish our claims upon it." "So that they may remember, we must forget," Vasily summed up...
            "But should we take umbrage at the fact? Should we feel shortchanged by the notion that their experiences for the moment may be richer than ours? I think not. For it is hardly our purpose at this late stage to log a new portfolio of lasting memories. Rather, we should be dedicating ourselves to ensuring that <i>they</i> taste freely of experience. And we must do so without trepidation. Rathering than tucking in blankets and buttoning up coats, we must have faith in them to tuck and button on their own. And if they fumble with their newfound liberty, we must remain composed, generous, judicious. We must encourage them to venture out from under our watchful gaze, and then sigh with pride when they pass at last through the revolving doors of life...." (322)
